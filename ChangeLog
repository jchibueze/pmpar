Version 1.0	Sep 6, 2000

	First public release.  The program does everything that it really
	needs too.  Possible improvements to do include overhauling the code
	to clean it up, allowing covariant error bars, doing likelyhood
	analysis, examining the covariance matrix, allowing multiple
	files to be processed together.
	
Version 1.1	Nov 29, 2000

	Minor update, mostly for better functionality with other code.
	o Prints transverse velocity (error bar on this is a todo)
	o Prints galactic coordinates
	o parallaxplot.py now can do multiple pulsars.  Bugfixes.
	o parallaxplot.py now can plot xy plots.  Use 'x' to options to use
	o allow -z and -s to be run without stop and inc
	o update example / documentation
	o added neplot.py to make a polar plot with several pulsars
		labeling the pulsar and ne
	o added -c option to print covariance matrix

Version 1.2	Dec 19, 2000

	Major bug fix.  This is an URGENT upgrade.  See README for details.
	o All internal calculations done in true milliarcseconds now.
	o parallaxplot.py cleanups.  
	  - Allow 'e' option for equal plot ranges when doing multiple plots
	  - Added 'l' option to enable epoch labels	
	o Added GPL licence to distribution in file LICENSE.  This
		applies to every file included in this distribution.

Version 1.3	Jan 11, 2001

	o Minor additional PM output: mu_b and mu_b calculated

Version 1.4	Feb 27, 2001

	o Major bug fixed!  URGENT upgrade.  The bug affects the
	  right ascension weights of high |dec| pulsars
	o Better interoperability with other code
	o parallaxplot.py upgrades
	o Biggles aspect ratio plot bug workaround

Version 1.5	Dec 13, 2002

	o Richard Dodson found a bug in muequ2gal.  Fixed.
	o Note that mu_a == mu_ra*cos(dec)

Version 1.6	Feb 3, 2017

	o Automake and autoheader used now
	o Some code cleanup
	o License files to each source file
	o Prep for hosting on github

Version 1.r76	Apr 22, 2017

	o Dec parse error for values between -1 and 0 degrees
