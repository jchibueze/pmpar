To do bootstrap Monte-Carlo iterations of pmpar, use the program
called bootstrap_pmpar.  This program runs pmpar and thus pmpar 
needs to be in your path.  Version 1.6 or greater of pmpar is needed.

The imput file should be a .dat file such as B0031-07.dat included in 
this directory.

Usage is described by running bootstrap_pmpar with no command line
parameters:

...............................................

parallax<143>% bootstrap_pmpar
bootstrap_pmpar version 1.0 -- Walter Brisken 20070124

Usage : bootstrap_pmpar <input file> <ifnum> [<num iterations>]

  <input file> is of .dat format
  <ifnum> is integer between 1 and 16, or "all" for all IFs
  <num interations> is integer > 0 [optional -- default = 1000]

Output is sent to stdout.  The 11 columns of output are:
  1.  RA (in seconds of time)
  2.  sigma RA (in seconds of time)
  3.  Dec (in arcsec)
  4.  sigma Dec (in arcsec)
  5.  mu_a (in mas/yr)
  6.  sigma mu_a (in mas/yr)
  7.  mu_d (in mas/yr)
  8.  sigma mu_d (in mas/yr)
  9.  pi (in mas)
  10. sigma pi (in mas)
  11. epoch mask -- list of epoch numbers used (0-based)

Note that pmpar version 1.6 or greater must be in your path

For example:

bootstrap_pmpar B0031-07.dat 1 10 > B0031-07.bmc

This will select IF 1 from the .dat file, run 10 iterations of
bootstrap montecarlo and redirect the output to B0031-07.bmc .
The output file will be 11 lines long.  The first line is the
result of pmpar using each selected epoch once.

All IFs can be combined together with:

bootstrap_pmpar B0031-07.dat all 10 > B0031-07.bmc

Note that for useful tests many thousand iterations should be 
done.
