				PMPAR

Note:	Versions before 1.4 have serious bugs that incorrectly handles
	all right ascensions.  For sources very close to zero declination
	there will be no effect, but for sources more than 15 degrees 
	from the equator are suspect to inconsistencies
			

This package contains source code for pmpar, the parallax and proper motion
fitting program.  Please read pmpar.doc for usage information.
The vert minimal homepage for this program is at
http://nacho.princeton.edu/~walterfb/pmpar/pmpar.html .  This is where
the latest version can be found.

To install:

1.	Prepare the gnu-style build system:

aclocal
autoconf
autoheader
automake -a

2.	./configure

Here you can pass options such as install paths if you like

2.	make
	
This compiles pmpar and other code in this distribution.  No files are
created outside this directory.

3.	make install

This copies the newly compiled software to its install_dir.  You may need
to be root to install in some locations.


Other Included Software

There is a small collection of other tools in this distribution:

parallaxplot.py - a python script to plot the parallax and proper motion
solutions.  No documentation yet.  Please contact the author (see below)
if help is needed.  Examples:

	parallaxplot.py example.pmpar 
	parallaxplot.py example.pmpar -om
	parallaxplot.py example.pmpar -op


The Biggles package for plotting in python is required to use this program.
Go to http://biggles.sourceforge.net/ to learn more about it and how to
install it.  It is very useful for python programmers needing to make
scientific plots.

neplot.py - a python script to produce a polar plot with distances and 
n_e.  This script now requires pdf.py, not included here, for functionality.
Please contact author if help is wanted.
